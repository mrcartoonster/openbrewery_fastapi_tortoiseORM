# OpenBreweryDB Clone in FastAPI!
---

[OpenBreweryDB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org) API clone using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)! This is my first FastAPI app after going through TestDrivenio's [FastAPI course](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/?utm_source=mrcartoonster). TestDrivenio's FastAPI course is a beast of course and what I've done here is just the minimal. The course will show how to add your FastAPI to docker, push to heroku and set GitHub actions with a breeze! Other than the main focus of the course being FastAPI with pytest and Docker, there's a couple of Python hidden jewels in this course that are beyond! The two libraries you'll be introduced to are [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [TortoiseORM](https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Don't forget to star [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)! FastAPI need's to break into Python's top web frameworks.
